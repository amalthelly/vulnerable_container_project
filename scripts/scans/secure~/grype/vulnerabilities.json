The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger.

is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00263,"percentile":0.49356,"date":"2026-02-11"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"2.1.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","versionConstraint":">=2.0.0,<2.2.2 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9f8573585c844f87","name":"urllib3","version":"2.1.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:c54ecd9e0c97941339fb84031ca3f2c07703dabdf31dfbccd48aa9e2559b469b","accessPath":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:c54ecd9e0c97941339fb84031ca3f2c07703dabdf31dfbccd48aa9e2559b469b","accessPath":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:2.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@2.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-6297","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-6297","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"It was discovered that dpkg-deb does not properly sanitize directory permissions when extracting a control member into a temporary directory, which is documented as being a safe operation even on untrusted data.

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL\nto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack\n\nImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted\nsources might terminate abruptly.\n\nA file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an\nuntrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this

an open-source software package that provides some useful decorators and context managers, has a Zip Slip path traversal vulnerability in the `jaraco.context.tarball()` function starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 6.1.0. The vulnerability may allow attackers to extract files outside the intended extraction directory when malicious tar archives are processed. The strip_first_component filter splits the path on the first `/` and extracts the second component, while allowing `../` sequences. Paths like `dummy_dir/../../etc/passwd` become `../../etc/passwd`. Note that this suffers from a nested tarball attack as well with multi-level tar files such as `dummy_dir/inner.tar.gz`, where the inner.tar.gz includes a traversal `dummy_dir/../../config/.env` that also gets translated to `../../config/.env`. Version 6.1.0 contains a patch for the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":8.6,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-23949","epss":0.00056,"percentile":0.17452,"date":"2026-02-11"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-23949","cwe":"CWE-22","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"jaraco-context","version":"5.3.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-58pv-8j8x-9vj2","versionConstraint":">=5.2.0,<6.1.0

This vulnerability allows for a range of attacks including cache poisoning, session manipulation, and data exposure.","cvss":[{"source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-1135","epss":0.0004,"percentile":0.11787,"date":"2026-02-11"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-1135","cwe":"CWE-444","source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"gunicorn","version":"21.2.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-w3h3-4rj7-4ph4","versionConstraint":"<22.0.0 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"22.0.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9f61e32b764c1257","name":"gunicorn","version":"21.2.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn-21.2.0.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:c54ecd9e0c97941339fb84031ca3f2c07703dabdf31dfbccd48aa9e2559b469b","accessPath":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn-21.2.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn-21.2.0.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:c54ecd9e0c97941339fb84031ca3f2c07703dabdf31dfbccd48aa9e2559b469b","accessPath":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn-21.2.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn-21.2.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","layerID":"sha256:c54ecd9e0c97941339fb84031ca3f2c07703dabdf31dfbccd48aa9e2559b469b","accessPath":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/gunicorn-21.2.0.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneau_project:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneau_project:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneauproject:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneauproject:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneau_project:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneau:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneau:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneauproject:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitc_project:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitc_project:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-gunicorn:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-gunicorn:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_gunicorn:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_gunicorn:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitcproject:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitcproject:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoit_chesneau:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitc_project:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:gunicorn:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:gunicorn:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python-gunicorn:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python_gunicorn:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitc:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitc:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitcproject:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python-gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python_gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:gunicorn:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:benoitc:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:gunicorn:21.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/gunicorn@21.2.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-15366","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15366","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6262704b134db2a4ba12e85ecfbd968534f28b45","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/143921","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/143922","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/DD7C7JZJYTBXMDOWKCEIEBJLBRU64OMR/"],"description":"The imaplib module, when passed a user-controlled command, can have additional commands injected using newlines.

Starting in version 1.0 and prior to 2.6.0, the Streaming API improperly handles highly compressed data. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. When streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP Content-Encoding header (e.g., gzip, deflate, br, or zstd). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation. The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":8.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-66471","epss":0.00027,"percentile":0.07022,"date":"2026-02-11"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-66471","cwe":"CWE-409","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"2.1.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2xpw-w6gg-jr37","versionConstraint":">=1.0,<2.6.0 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.6.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9f8573585c844f87","name":"urllib3","version":"2.1.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:c54ecd9e0c97941339fb84031ca3f2c07703dabdf31dfbccd48aa9e2559b469b","accessPath":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:c54ecd9e0c97941339fb84031ca3f2c07703dabdf31dfbccd48aa9e2559b469b","accessPath":"/home/appuser/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:2.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@2.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-7709","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-7709","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"An integer overflow exists in the  FTS5 https://sqlite.org/fts5.html  extension.

When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption. Starting in version 1.22 and prior to version 2.6.3, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger excessive resource consumption on the client.

Prior to 46.0.5, the public_key_from_numbers (or EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key()), EllipticCurvePublicNumbers.public_key(), load_der_public_key() and load_pem_public_key() functions do not verify that the point belongs to the expected prime-order subgroup of the curve. This missing validation allows an attacker to provide a public key point P from a small-order subgroup. This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as S = [victim_private_key]P via ECDH, this leaks information about victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order). For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key. When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup. Only SECT curves are impacted by this.
